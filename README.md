# LAT_LCs

Python scripts to scrape Fermi-LAT public light curve page (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/) and to download FITS files and plot lightcurves.

They have been tested with Anaconda Python 3.5 on Mac OS X.

The scripts are made to run quiet so they can be used in batch mode / cron jobs: use options '-h' for help and '-v' for a bit of verbosity. Remember to chmod +x them so they are executable from the command line.
