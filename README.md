# LAT_LCs

Python scripts to scrape Fermi-LAT public light curve page (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/) and to download FITS files and plot lightcurves.

The scripts are made to run quiet so they can be used in batch mode / cron jobs: use -h for help and -v for a bit of verbosity.
